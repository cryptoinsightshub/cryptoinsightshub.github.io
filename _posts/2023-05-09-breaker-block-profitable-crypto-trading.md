A Breaker Block is a candle block that disrupts the market structure due to a swing movement in the price. It is essentially an order block that has failed to hold its level.

Before diving into the Breaker Block definition, take a look at the image below to understand the concept. Let's examine it in more detail.

1. It is a region where the price reacts and pulls back. When the price completes its correction and reaches the same territory, level (a) is considered to act as resistance. As a result, traders may sell their assets or open short trades in the spot market. At this point, the price crosses the region and creates a new high (2), causing those who take bearish trades to fail (those who open short trades are stopped, and liquidity is taken). Moreover, breaking the (a) level shifts the bias of investors and traders to Long.

2. For those who have moved to Long with the break of (a), the Market Maker begins to seek a correction. This movement, starting from the top 2 and continuing below the (a) level, is a liquidity operation. Here, both Long and Short directional transactions are stopped.

3. When the price completes the correction of top 2 and crosses level (b) to top 3, the market maker repeats the same process. All these movements constitute the trend, as observed. These liquidity movements ensure that the price reaches a certain level within a trend (movements indicated by a pink triangle).

The same situations and scenarios apply to the downtrend.

There are three entry methods in specific Supply & Demand zones, which apply to all other specific Supply & Demand regions. Let's explain them in order:

1. Entering the transaction from within the region's borders, expecting the price to react when it reaches the determined region. This method is considered the riskiest, as each region has non-operational situations and other factors.
2. Following the price in a lower time frame when it reaches the determined region and trading with a market breakout in the expected direction in the lower time frame or by testing this market breakout.
3. When the price reaches the region, following it in a lower time frame and trading with Reversal candlestick structures formed in the expected direction.

In a downtrend, the price takes out liquidity at the highs, breaking down past the breaker block. When it retraces back to the breaker block, this is where we can open a profitable short position.

In an uptrend, we would look for the price to take out the lows as liquidity before breaking up past the breaker block. When it retraces to the breaker block, this can be a profitable long position.

For example, in a short trade, if we've identified that the overall market structure is bearish, we wait for equal highs to be created before the highs are taken out.
